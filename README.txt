This website is a build your own adventure I made for my kid.
Simply choose the options below the book to continue on through the story.
This story follows Bears' adventure one Saturday.

I used CSS vw to allow the page to shrink and grow based on screen size.
I created relative and absolute css rules to keep the book/image/and text correctly oriented with each other.
I used z-index to place the book under everything but the background.

I used if / else if javascript to allow my buttons to flow through the story.
I used image_tracker to allow my buttons clicks to keep the story flowing.
